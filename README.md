Doing this project was fun, I was amazed by how simple it was to integrate ready to use AI (made by others) to our web apps. I've learned a lot, spent also a lot just to have access to these AI models. Learning AI was worth it. NOTE: On deploment, some services may not work due to free tier limits.
